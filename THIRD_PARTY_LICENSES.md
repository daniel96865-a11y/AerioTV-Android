## FFmpeg (LGPL-2.1-or-later)

`app/libs/media3-decoder-ffmpeg.aar` bundles a build of FFmpeg. It is wired in as
the fallback software audio renderer and supplies AAC, AC-3, E-AC-3, DTS, TrueHD
and MP2 decoding on devices with no hardware MediaCodec for those codecs, or
whose platform decoder offers them only as a passthrough bitstream.

| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | https://ffmpeg.org |
| Version | FFmpeg `release/6.0` (libavcodec 60.3.100) |
| Source | https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/release/6.0 |
| Modifications | None. Upstream source is used unmodified. |
| License | GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later |

The library is configured through the Media3 `decoder_ffmpeg` extension's
`build_ffmpeg.sh` **without** `--enable-gpl`, enabling only these decoders:

```
aac ac3 eac3 dca truehd mlp mp2 mp3 flac alac
```

Those ten cover, in order: AAC (including HE-AAC / AAC+), AC-3, E-AC-3 (Dolby
Digital Plus), DTS / DTS-HD core, TrueHD, MLP, MPEG audio layers II and III,
FLAC and Apple Lossless.

All of the above are LGPL-clean. No GPL-only component (x264, x265, libpostproc)
is linked in. `eac3`, `dca`, `truehd` and `mlp` were removed on 2026-09-11, and
`aac` on 2026-09-12; all five were restored on 2026-09-14, matching the decoder
set that VLC and Kodi ship. Without them, a device whose platform decoder exposes
E-AC-3 for bitstream only played those tracks silent whenever surround
passthrough was off, and HE-AAC (AAC+ / SBR) on-demand recordings had no fallback
for the hardware AAC decoders that fail on them. See the
Patents section of [README.md](README.md) for the patent notice that accompanies
these decoders. The complete, reproducible build steps are recorded in
[app/libs/README.md](app/libs/README.md).

### Relinking

FFmpeg is loaded as a dynamically linked JNI shared object (`libffmpegJNI.so`),
so it can be replaced with a modified build, as section 6 of the LGPL requires.
To do so: rebuild the AAR following `app/libs/README.md`, replace
`app/libs/media3-decoder-ffmpeg.aar`, and rebuild the app.

If you would rather receive the corresponding FFmpeg source directly, open an
issue at https://github.com/jonzey231/AerioTV-Android/issues and it will be
provided.
